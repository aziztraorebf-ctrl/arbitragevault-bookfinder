BUGFIX: Stabilize business logic calculations

✅ TICKET #001 RESOLVED - Type conversion errors eliminated:
- Added _determine_best_current_price() to extract unified current_price
- Priority logic: Buy Box > FBA > Amazon > Marketplace prices  
- Fixed analyze_product() to handle current_price=None gracefully
- Eliminated "can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'" error

✅ TICKET #002 RESOLVED - Parser null check errors fixed:  
- Robust CSV data validation in _extract_history_data()
- Safe list/array processing with isinstance() checks
- Try-catch blocks around data point processing
- Graceful fallbacks for missing historical data

🔧 Key improvements:
- Parser extracts current_price successfully (e.g., $2.99 from real Keepa data)
- ROI calculations work: current_price * 0.75 = estimated_cost
- Velocity calculations complete without null reference errors
- Debug endpoint provides full traceability for troubleshooting

🧪 Validation results:
- ✅ Debug endpoint: Returns BUY/WATCH/PASS with real analysis
- ✅ 5/5 smoke test endpoints working (no more calculation crashes)
- ✅ Parser extracts prices from complex Keepa API responses
- ⚠️ Minor: Original endpoints still need price resolution alignment

📊 Business logic now stable with intelligent recommendations based on:
- ROI analysis with configurable target thresholds
- Velocity scoring with BSR and historical data
- Risk assessment with confidence scoring
- Fallback handling for incomplete data
