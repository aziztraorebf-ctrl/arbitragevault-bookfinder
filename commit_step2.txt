Phase 2 Step 2: Keepa Models & DB Migration

- Add KeepaProduct, KeepaSnapshot, CalcMetrics, IdentifierResolutionLog models
- Hybrid approach: core fields + JSONB for flexibility (raw_data, metrics_data)
- Migration script with PostgreSQL JSONB support and proper indexes
- Models aligned with Base class (UUID primary keys, created_at/updated_at)
- Support for profit calculations (ROI, margin, breakeven, target_buy_price)
- Velocity scoring fields (rank_percentile_30d, buybox_uptime_30d, etc.)
- Full cascade delete relationships for data integrity
- Resolution logging for ISBN -> ASIN tracking

Schema:
âœ… keepa_products: stable metadata (24h TTL)
âœ… keepa_snapshots: volatile pricing/BSR (30-60min TTL) 
âœ… calc_metrics: computed business metrics
âœ… identifier_resolution_log: resolution tracking
