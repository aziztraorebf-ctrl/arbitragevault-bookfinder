Phase 2 Step 3: Calculation Engine & Keepa Parser

- Add comprehensive Amazon fees calculation (referral, closing, FBA, prep)
- Implement ROI metrics: profit, margin, breakeven, target_buy_price
- Build velocity scoring (0-100): BSR percentile, rank improvements, buybox uptime
- Create Keepa data parser: price/BSR history, product metadata extraction
- Support multiple categories (books, media, default) with specific fee configs
- Combined analysis with weighted scoring (ROI 60%, Velocity 40%)
- Business recommendations: STRONG BUY / BUY / CONSIDER / PASS

Tests:
âœ… Fees calculation: $25 book â†’ -2% ROI (realistic with fees)
âœ… ROI analysis: $28.99 / $12.50 â†’ 42.5% ROI (profitable)
âœ… Velocity scoring: 63.69/100 with improving BSR trend
âœ… All fee categories and profit tiers working
