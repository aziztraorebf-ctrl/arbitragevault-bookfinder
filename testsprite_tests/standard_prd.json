  "product_overview": "ArbitrageVault is a production-ready FastAPI backend service designed for book arbitrage analysis integrating real-time Amazon marketplace data via Keepa API. It offers comprehensive strategic analytics, batch processing, user authentication, and robust database connection management optimized for modern deployment environments such as Render.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide reliable and scalable backend services for book arbitrage analysis with real-time data retrieval.",
    "Ensure database stability and performance with async connection pooling and SSL support in a production environment.",
    "Implement secure JWT-based user authentication and session management.",
    "Deliver advanced business logic for profit and velocity scoring with strategic recommendations.",
    "Offer batch processing capabilities for efficient handling of multiple analyses.",
    "Enable health monitoring endpoints for system and database readiness.",
    "Maintain comprehensive API documentation and robust testing with seamless integration to frontend systems."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Health Check API with liveness and readiness probes including database connectivity validation.",
    "AsyncIO PostgreSQL Database Manager using SQLAlchemy with optimized connection pooling and SSL support for Render platform.",
    "Pydantic-based configuration management with automatic transformation for asyncpg database URLs.",
    "JWT-based Authentication API supporting user registration, login, and session management.",
    "Detailed Book Analysis API performing ROI, profit, velocity, and risk calculations with market data processing.",
    "Batch Processing API handling multiple book analysis requests with progress tracking.",
    "Keepa Integration API providing Amazon product data retrieval, price history, and product search capabilities.",
    "Advanced business logic engine implementing multiple strategic scoring views such as Profit Hunter and Velocity.",
    "Comprehensive RESTful routing adhering to best practices for CRUD and status update operations.",
    "Robust error handling and resilience mechanisms including retry logic and fallback handling for API limits."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User registers and authenticates using JWT-based Authentication API.",
    "Authenticated user submits single or batch ASINs for analysis via Keepa Integration API.",
    "System fetches product and market data from Keepa and processes it through the Business Logic Engine.",
    "User receives detailed analysis including ROI, velocity scores, risk assessment, and strategic recommendations.",
    "User can query batch processing statuses and retrieve updated analysis results.",
    "Health endpoints continuously monitor application and database readiness for maintenance and load balancing.",
    "Developers monitor API status, logs, and deploy updates via integrated Render MCP diagnostics.",
    "Frontend integrates with backend APIs for a seamless experience in niche bookmarking, analysis results browsing, and batch processing management."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Successful TLS/SSL connection to PostgreSQL database without sslmode errors.",
    "Health endpoints respond appropriately: liveness returns alive status and readiness returns accurate database health status.",
    "All backend API endpoints respond with expected data structures and handle error cases with proper HTTP status codes.",
    "Authentication mechanisms securely issue and validate JWT tokens with correct session lifecycle management.",
    "Business logic calculations match expected ROI, velocity, risk, and profit metrics validated against test cases.",
    "Batch processing handles large inputs efficiently, maintaining system responsiveness and data integrity.",
    "Integration with Keepa API respects rate limits and returns accurate, real-time product data consistently.",
    "Codebase passes all unit, integration, and end-to-end test suites with performance benchmarks met (e.g., analysis response < 2s).",
    "Database connection pool settings optimize resource usage on Render with no connection leak or premature closures.",
    "Repository pattern implementations are corrected to include required model arguments, eliminating initialization errors.",
    "API documentation is complete, reflecting all current endpoints and their schemas for developer usability."
